<+> Since I always try and follow the programming principle of DNRY I knew that
 I had to optimize the problem right away. I found a for loop would be most 
 effective for this particular task and I was successfully able to implement 
 this. I am very happy I was able to successfully implement a loop in java and 
 work with variables successfully. 

(-) The only major problem I had was when it came to calculating the test scores 
averages. I was getting an int answer even tho it should have been a double. 
But then I remembered how casting works and realized it would successfully work 
in this case. 

+ I had a very fun time with this project and the new challenges it brought up. 
I was even able to optimize the program further with fewer variables (a version 
I did not submit) and was very helpful in trying to further develop my coding 
abilities.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // local variables
        int numTests = 0; // counts number of tests
        int testGrade = 0; // individual test grade
        int totalPoints = 0; // total points for all tests
        double average = 0.0; // average grade2

        int[] testScores = { 95, 73, 91, 82, 34, 73, 100, 76, 99 };

        for (int i = 0; i < testScores.length; i++) {
            numTests++;
            testGrade = testScores[i];
            totalPoints += testScores[i];
            average = ((double) totalPoints) / numTests;
            System.out.println("Test # " + numTests + "\t" + "Test Grade: " + testGrade + "\t" + "Total Points: "
                    + totalPoints + "\t" + "Average Scores: " + average);
        }

    }
