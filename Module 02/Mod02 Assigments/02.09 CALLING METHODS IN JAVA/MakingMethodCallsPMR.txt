<+> I was able to pratice calling methods (or functions in JS) 
again which was fun. It reminded me of how larger projects work 
and looking into the future with more complicated code. 

<-> I accidently named the file two diffrent things without 
realizing so I had to recheck every line of code twice before 
catching my mistake. 

+ I learned how to call mathods in java and how similar it is 
to doing it in C++ which I was not expecting.
